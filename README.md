*Pre-requisite Knowledge:* YouTube is an American free to use online video sharing and social media platform launched in February 2005. It is currently one of the biggest video platforms where its users watch more than 1 billion hours of videos every day.\
Closed captions are the text derived from the video which are intended for adding more details (such as dialogues, speech translation, non-speech elements) for the viewer. They are widely used to understand video without understanding its audio.
